Description:

Spine animator is component which animates your skeleton's spine bones accordingly to movement.
It's simulating real animal-like spine movement without any need of additional animating or coding.
This component will make your animations look much more real without wasting a lot of time
for making decent animations of walking / running to sides by your creatures and without
spending a lot of money for animator to create this animations.
Another benefit from this procedural animating is that all movement of bones is continious, 
so it feels more real if your creature is rotating, stopping it etc.

Main features:
- Includes interactive demo scenes
- Includes full source code
- Easy setup and incredible effect
- Fully cooperating with keyframed animations
- Not needed any coding
- Visual friendly inspector window with helpful features
- Highly customizable
- Very high performance
- Blending with original animation

Packages Contests:
Spine Animator - Demo Scenes.unitypackage
Package contains demo scenes for Spine Animator component with script and models from my
free package fBasicAssets to make demo scenes interactive.
__________________________________________________________________________________________

Known issues:
- When your model is very long it can disappear sometimes, that's caused by skinned mesh render which's bounding box is going out of sight
in next versions there will be added option to adjust bounds dynamically by component.
- Depends on your skeleton, when you jump or so, skeleton segments can rotate in opposite direction, you can toggle 'Chain Method' inside 'Basic Correction' Tab
- Connecting tail using spine animator in the same time using spine animator on spine bones can be sometimes problematic, depends on your skeleton
it can be too hard, then I recommend using my other package "Tail Animator" which gives good result without any additional tweaks

Changelog:

v2.0.1
- Added IK Controlled Bones Fixer which helps Spine Animator handle animation rigs with disconnected leg end limbs like paws 
- Few inspector window fixes
- Few straightening behaviour fixes
- Added "SpineAnimatorQueuer" component to manage updating multiple Spine Animators at once (for creatures which use more than 1 SpineAnimator component)

v2.0.0

!!! Warning for version 2.0.0 !!!
Many variables changed, some of them was replaced by other ones.
If you was using Spine Animator previously, click on objects with Spine Animator to convert them to new version and apply changes.
To avoid compilation errors, remove previous directory of spine animator from project then import V2

- Refreshed inspector GUI
- Added language support for inspector GUI headers: English, Polish, Russian (translator - t), Japanese (t), Chinese (t), Korean (t)
- Upgraded scene gizmos to make setting up spine chain easier
- Refactored code, cleaned and optimized (Now Spine Animator works two times faster and without garbage collector peaks)
- Removed many anchoring parameters, now they're not needed anymore everything now is detected automatically
- No more option for positions and rotations not animated, it's replaced by "Detect Zero Keyframes"
- Now update rate can be defined for more stable motion / optimization in high/low FPS
- Added many new small parameters

v1.0.7

- Added option "Optimize with mesh" to disable spine animator when target mesh is not visiblei n any camera view
- Removed SpineAnimator Perchance components
- Changed placement of parameters inside inspector window so the most common ones are in one tab and advanced ones in other tab
- Added possibility to remove selective bones from spine chain in "Spine Transforms" foldout
- Added "Auto anchor" option
- Improved some gizmos inside scene view for more effective debugging

v1.0.6
- Added Chain Method "Universal" which is working without any issue with translations in any axis.
Tested on many models which needed to have selected right chain method before.
Probably all chain methods will be removed soon if universal chain method will be tested enough.
- Few fixes inside inspector view and scene view
- Now you can disable collision for selective segment with "Segment Collision" toggle list
- Fixed terrain collision when spine leaves terrain mesh in x and z axes
- Component will try to find correct bones to init chain by searching them by names

v1.0.5
- Added experimental physics option where you can choose colliders with which collision of spine segments should be detected
- As physics are implemented, there is variable 'Gravity' which you can use to keep spine on the ground if creature is very long (like millipede)
- Added tips to creating spine chain inside inspector window
- Added alert (red gui color) if there is no animator and component tries 'Connect with animator' to remind about that
- Added new example scene with use of collision also collision added to 'Fillipede' and 'Fockatrice' example scene


v1.0.4
- Reworked main algorithm to work better with complicated bone structure orientations to use under new variable 'ChainMethod' named as 'Axis Based'
- Added MaxStretching variable to limit stretching of model when using position smoother variable
- Added 'Springness' variable to adjust more jiggly feeling for models with 'First bone leading' structure
- Added 'Slithery' variable, when setted to one it gives the same motion like in previous version but cranking it down will result in more damped motion of spine
- Added component Spine Bone Connector to repair wrong connection of bones without need of rebuilding it inside modelling software
- Added toggle "Safe Delta Time" to remove chopping motion if fps are very unstable
- Upgraded limiting angles algorithm resulting in more smooth motion for limiting maximum rotation of spine chain's individual segments
- Added warning if bone structure is created and main object don't face forward axis (z:blue axis)
- Above upgrades and fixes made component work better in low fps domain
- Some small updates inside inspector window

v1.0.3
- Added icons on the right inside hierarchy to easily find objects with attached Spine Animator
- Added menu items so you can find Spine Animator also by clicking "Add Component" > "FImpossible Creations" > "Spine Animator"

V1.0.2
- Added support for physical clock, if you need to have enabled "Animate Physics" in animator, "Physical Clock" variable will make Spine Animator work right with it
- Added variable "Distances Multiplier" and few others in "Advanced" tab, they can be used to get different results, for example for humanoid spines
- Added humanoid demo scenes and "Fockatrice" demo scene (monster reminding Cockatrice)
- Variables which does nothing in playmode will be visible only in editor mode
- Added variable "CustomAnchorRotationOffset" for correcting in case of custom anchor works wrong

V1.0.1
- Changed "Pivot Offset" variable name to "Segments Pivot Offset"
- Added variable "BasePivotOffset" to adjust rotation placement
- Added text file with manual in text version so anyone who couldn't use it with translator now can
